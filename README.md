Money Manager is a budgeting web application built with JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express.js, and allows you to manage multiple bank accounts and track your spending. 

This is project is still under construction and is not yet hosted. The site is fully mobile responsive. Sessions are enabled through Express-Session. Redis is used for caching. Security is implemented through b-crypt and other measures. 
I will be working on the dashboard to include graphs and charts of the budget data soon and should have the project hosted in the near future.

Technologies:

Language: JavaScript
Server:  Node.js and Express.js, Redis, Docker 
Database: Postgres, Database Integration/ORM: Knex.js
Front-End: React, Tachyons CSS Library
